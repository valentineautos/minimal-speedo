A minimal speedo design being used and developed by [Garage Tinkering](https://www.youtube.com/@GarageTinkering) on YouTube for a Nissan 350z

It needs to be used in conjunction with a common core found at https://github.com/valentineautos/minimal-gauges-common that should to be placed in your libraries.
If using the same ESP32-S3 LCD Driver boards and ST7701 RGB LCD screens like in the demo you will also need https://github.com/valentineautos/esp32-s3-lcd-driver-config in your libraries
